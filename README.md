# mat++

A language centered around Matrix Algebra operations.

## TODO:
- Design grammar/syntax
- Write lexer
- Write parser (most likely stack based)
- Translate to intcode (or some variant)
- Write interpreter
- REPL and file support
- ...

## Wanted language features:
- Variables
- Basic math
- Matrix math (addition, subtraction, multiplication, square matrix with
  exponents).
- More advanced matrix operations (Gauss-Jordan elimination, and more)
- Vector math (dot and cross product)
- Appending matrices
- Functions
- ...

## Implementation language:
- Probably C++ or something else fast
